#What are Functions?

#Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks,
# allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save
# some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers
# can share their code.

    print("Hello From My Function!")
username = "Bert"
greetings = "Hej"

    print("Hello, %s, From My Function!, I wish you %s" %(username, greeting))

def sum_two_numbers(a,b):
    return a + b

my_function()

#How do you call functions in Python?
#Simply write the function's name followed by (), placing any required arguments
# within the brackets.
