#In programming, a module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality.
# For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for
# the game logic, and another module would be responsible for drawing the game on
# the screen. Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately.

#Modules in Python are simply Python files with a .py extension. The name of the
# module will be the name of the file. A Python module can have a set of functions,
# classes or variables defined and implemented. In the example above, we will have
# two files, we will have:

#mygame/
#mygame/game.py
#mygame/draw.py
