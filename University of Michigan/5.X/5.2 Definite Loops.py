#Definite loops
#A siple definite loop

for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] : #for is the keyword for definite loops
    print(i)
print("Blastoff!")

friends = ["Joseph", "Glenn", "Sally"]
for friend in friends : #Interation variable friend will go through each of the strings in friends
    print("Happy New Year:", friend)
print("Done!")

#You can think of the "for" statement as a sort of complex thing. Are we done yet, no, move ahead to the next statement
#and print it, on and on and on until its done

#Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through the loop. These iberation
#variables move through the sequence or set
